# BadHonnefTutorial

This repository contains the files for the tutorial sessions on MPS algorithms, held October 2020 in Bad Honnefm on Tensor Network based approaches to Quantum Many-Body Systems.

## Installation

### Windows

### Ubuntu
Clone the repository to some local folder, and unpack.
Open a terminal and from there start a jupyter notebook with
```console
jupyter notebook
```

### Other
If installing 'jupyter' is not an option, you can use the online service provided by (https://colab.research.google.com/). This works either directly by locating the github repository through colab, however for the images to work you should clone the repository and upload it to your google drive, and work from there.

## Usage
The tutorial is split into 3 chapters:
1. Uniform MPS and gauges
2. Gradient descent and vumps
3. Excitations and MPOs

Each chapter contains a jupyter notebook (.ipyb) file, with guided exercices on implementing the algorithms, as well as a solution file for both Python (.p) and Matlab (.m).
