    "One of the great things of MPS is that they provide efficient approximations of physical states, and for gapped systems they are expected to be exact in the limit $D \\rightarrow \\infty$. The idea is that if we increase the bond dimension enough, we can get to arbitrary precision. However, increasing the bond dimension comes at a numerical cost, as the MPS algorithms scale in $D$. It is possible to ensure that the complexity of all MPS algorithms scales as $O(D^3)$, however this means we need to be a little smarter with the previously encountered algorithms."
